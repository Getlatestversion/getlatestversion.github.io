This has been done trying to reduce the time required for the build and for their integration, to ease Integrated Development Environment in opening hundreds of projects, and other.\nThe main consequence of having multiple solutions is binary composition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"what-is-binary-composition\"\u003eWhat is binary composition?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinary composition occurs when one or more solutions reference the compiled binaries of another solution. Let suppose it is needed to make the binaries of Solution B available to Solution A before Solution A can build successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"visual-studio-references.jpg\" alt=\"image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are forced to commit the code together with the binaries produced by build in the repository\u0026hellip;Keep on reading :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"how-can-we-distribute-binaries\"\u003eHow can we distribute binaries?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can make those binaries available in several ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"git-repository\"\u003eGit repository\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA first possibility consists in committing them into a repository anytime a merge into the development/master branch by means of the Continuous Integration build pipeline is requested by a Pull Request. Of course, this increases the size of the repository introducing significant slowdown checkout times and performances. Imagine what could happen if teams work on different branches ending up using different versions of the same binaries creating merge conflicts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"file-share\"\u003eFile share\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother option consists in putting the binaries onto a file share. In this case, however, there is no index to find binaries quickly and there is no protection against overriding a version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"package-management-with-azure-artifacts\"\u003ePackage Management with Azure Artifacts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should definitely be the most suitable solution because it allows putting binaries into NuGet (and other as npm, Maven, Python, and universal) packages making it possible for Solution A to reference these packages. Among the several advantages introduced by this methodology, in Continuous Integration Azure pipeline a NuGet published task can be added in order to make the update versioning procedure automatic and distributing it in a reliable way also.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"title":"About","date_published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"http://www.getlatestversion.eu/about/","url":"http://www.getlatestversion.eu/about/","content_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/320px-Flag_of_Europe.svg.png\" alt=\"Europe flag\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-us\"\u003eAbout Us\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetLatestVersion.eu stems from GetLatestVersion.it, the successful Italian community specialised on DevOps, Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-we-do\"\u003eWhat we do\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe publish posts and articles on DevOps, Agile, tools, design, implementation techniques.\nOur \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/GetLatestVersion\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e hosts useful video of different kind: short introductions to a topic or tool, longer presentation on experiences and conference sessions.\nIn addition, we organise events in person and online on DevOps, Agile, ALM and SDLC topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"title":"Privacy","date_published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"http://www.getlatestversion.eu/page/privacy/","url":"http://www.getlatestversion.eu/page/privacy/","content_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"list-of-cookies-used-in-this-site\"\u003eList of Cookies used in this site\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoogle Analytics cookies\u003c/strong\u003e: __utma, __utmb, __utmc, __utmv, __utmz, used to gather site statistic usage.
